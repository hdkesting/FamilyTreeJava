        <p>The "Persons" are the various individuals that are registered in the system. Relations between individuals are registered in "Families".
        A person can be registered as "child" or as "spouse" in a particular family. Of course he or she will be child in one real family
            (although that family may not be registered here) and may be spouse in another family (or more).
